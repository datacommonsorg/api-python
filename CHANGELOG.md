**Release Status** - Current head of branch [`stable-1.x`](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/api-python/tree/stable-1.x)

Bugs fixed in new release

-   Fixed various typos and formatting issues in the documentation.
-   If the index of the `pandas.Series` passed into functions such as `get_populations` and `get_observations` was not contiguous, then the assignment step would not properly align the values returned by calling the function. This is because the `pandas.Series` returned by the function would have a different index than the given series. This is fixed by assigning the index of the returned series to that of the given series.
