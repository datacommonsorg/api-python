Many studies have been done on the medical bases of the disease, but it is widely known that societal factors, like public policy, can greatly affect case numbers. Today, we'll take advantage of Data Commons, an open-source project that allows us to easily combine data from multiple different sources, to analyze the impact of social factors on COVID-19 cases. While public policy is hard to quantify into a data point, perhaps we can find other social factors that correlate with the number of COVID-19 cases.\n",
