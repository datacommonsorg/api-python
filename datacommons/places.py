""" Data Commons Python Client API Places Module.

Provides convenience functions for working with Places in the Data Commons
knowledge graph. This submodule implements the ability to access :obj:`Place`'s
within a collection of nodes identified by dcid.

def get_places_in(dcids, place_type):
  """ Returns :obj:`Place`'s contained in :code:`dcids` of type `place_type`.

  Args:
    dcids (Union[:obj:`list` of :obj:`str`, :obj:`pandas.Series`]): Dcids to get
      contained in places.
    place_type (:obj:`str`): The type of places contained in the given dcids to
      filter by.

  Returns:
    When :code:`dcids` is an instance of :obj:`list`, the returned
    :obj:`Place`'s are formatted as a :obj:`dict` from a given dcid to a list of
    places identified by dcids of the given `place_type`.

    When :code:`dcids` is an instance of :obj:`pandas.Series`, the returned
    :obj:`Place`'s are formatted as a :obj:`pandas.Series` where the `i`-th
    entry corresponds to places contained in the place identified by the dcid
    in `i`-th cell if :code:`dcids`. The cells of the returned series will always
    contain a :obj:`list` of place dcids of the given `place_type`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the payload returned by the Data Commons REST API is
      malformed.

  Examples:
    We would like to get all Counties contained in
    `California <https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06>`_. Specifying
    the :code:`dcids` as a :obj:`list` resulst in the following.

    >>> get_places_in(["geoId/06"], "County")
    {
      'geoId/06': [
        'geoId/06041',
        'geoId/06089',
        'geoId/06015',
        'geoId/06023',
        'geoId/06067',
        ...
        # and 53 more
      ]
    }

    We can also specify the :code:`dcids` as a :obj:`pandas.Series` like so.

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> dcids = pd.Series(["geoId/06"])
    >>> get_places_in(dcids, "County")
    0    [geoId/06041, geoId/06089, geoId/06015, geoId/...
