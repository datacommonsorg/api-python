# Data Commons Python API

This is a Python library for accessing data in the Data Commons Graph.

To get started, install this package from pip.

```

To get additional functionality to work with Pandas DataFrames, install the package
with the optional Pandas dependency.

```bash
pip install "datacommons-client[Pandas]"
```

Once the package is installed, import `datacommons_client`.

```python
import datacommons_client as dc
```
