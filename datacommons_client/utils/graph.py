    This function performs a direct, uncached call to the API. It exists
    primarily to serve as the internal, cache-free fetch used by `fetch_parents_lru`, which
    applies LRU caching on top of this raw access function.

    By isolating the pure fetch logic here, we ensure that caching is handled separately
    and cleanly via `@lru_cache` on `fetch_parents_lru`, which requires its wrapped
    function to be deterministic and side-effect free.
