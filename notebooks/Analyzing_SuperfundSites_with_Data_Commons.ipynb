DataFrames allow access to all the data processing, analytical and visualization tools provided by packages such as pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",

The notebook will provide code snippets that can better showcase how data can be used for visualization and analysis. Specifically, the notebook uses statistics available on Superfund Sites and Demographics as examples, but the snippets can be used for statistics in other verticals like Climate, Economics, Health, etc.\n",

In particular, there are two types of entities: [StatisticalVariable](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=StatisticalVariable) and [StatVarObservation](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=StatVarObservation).\n",

Some examples include: median income, median income of females, number of high school graduates, unemployment rate, prevalence of diabetes, essentially anything one might call a metric, statistic, or measure. A StatVarObservation represents an actual measurement of a StatisticalVariable in a given place and time.\n",
        "\n",
        "One example of a StatisticalVariable is the median age of people in San Antonio, Texas in 2014. The statistical metric, time, and place here are median age, 2014, and San Antonio respectively. A list of StatisticalVariables can be found [here](http://docs.datacommons.org/statistical_variables.html). To read more about StatisticalVariable and StatVarObservation, please see [representing_statistics.md](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/blob/master/docs/representing_statistics.md).\n",

To begin with, we can use the [**`build_multivariate_dataframe`**](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/pandas/multivariate_dataframe.html) function to build a dataframe with the latest StatVarObservations of multiple StatisticalVariables for multiple places.\n",
