        "# Preamble\n",
        "This work was done in collaboration with Prof. Aditi Sheshadri's research group at Stanford University.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Context**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The climate at a specific location (as recorded by observations) can be seen as a sample from a \"real\" probability distribution function (PDF). We have a number of climate models, from many agencies across the world, that use physics to approximate this underlying PDF. Each simulation run of each of these models can be seen as a sample from the PDF embodied by the code in that model.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Some agencies publish the results of multiple simulation runs for their models while others publish a single set of predictions (from either a single simulation or an aggregation of multiple simulations).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Each model defines a set of polygons covering the earth. Results are typically hourly predictions (over the next several decades, starting from 10-20 years ago), for a number of variables (such as the maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation) for each of the polygons. The polygons are typically 100km x 100km or 0.5arc degree S2 cells. Combining results from different models is complicated by the differences in these geometries. Further, the large size of these polygons means that it is difficult to make predictions about most cities and counties, which are much smaller. Fortunately, NASA produces downscaled, normalized versions of the outputs of the most well regarded models. We use these downscaled models for our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Models also tend to have a bias, i.e., they either over or under estimate the temperature. Since the models typically start their prediction at some time in the past (e.g., 2005), the differences between observed and predicted values can be used to estimate and compensate for these biases. The NASA downscaled data incorporates this bias correction.\n",
        "\n",
        "   We would like to answer the following class of questions: given a place (typically an administrative area), what is the highest / lowest temperature that is likely to be reached, for some period of time (e.g., one day), during some period of time (e.g., 2024 or 2030-2040) with X% likelihood (for X=1% and X=5%). To answer these questions, we first reconstruct the PDF of the variable (highest or lowest temperature) in question and then answer the question by sampling from this PDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Consider the case of estimating the highest temperature $T$ on a single day, in a single given year, with a likelihood of $X$%. To do this, we\n",
        "   1.  construct the PDF of daily highest temperature.\n",
        "   2.  pick a $T$. Let the cumulative probability of the highest temperature being less than $T$ on a randomly chosen day be $p$.\n",
        "   3. We compute the probability of the temperature being less than $T$ on every day of that year. We iterate on $T$ till we find a $T$ where this probability is $1-X$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Constructing the PDF**\n",
        "\n",
        "   We have some number of models (see below for the list of models we use in this analysis) and for each we have a table of maximum temperature and date. From this, we construct the PDF. We try the following approaches.\n",
        "   1. We quantize the temperature into $1^oC$ ranges and build the histogram of temperatures vs the number of days where that is the highest temperature. The probability of the highest temperature being $T$ can be read off this histogram. This is a very conservative approach, where the temperatures are bound to within the range of predictions for that year. Given that the table from the model itself is just an estimate, the actual highest temperature could indeed be higher than what is in the table. The next approach tries to do this.\n",
        "   2. We can fit a distribution to the points in the table. We experiment with Gaussian, Gamma, and mixture of Gaussians. We notice that the problem with simple Gaussian and Gamma is that while they do predict much higher temperatures, they are not aware of physical limits (e.g., they assign a non-zero probability to the temperature exceeding $100^oC$). So, as the time period (over which the prediction is done) gets longer, the probability of much more extreme events goes up, well into unrealistic territory. We notice that mixture of Gaussians does have more realistic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The purpose of this exercise is to enable planning for extreme weather events. We notice that even with the most conservative histogram based approach, there are likely to be days, in the next decade, where the temperature exceeds $50^oC$, a dangerous threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Independence**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Let the cumulative probability of the temperature being less than $T$ on a randomly chosen day be $p$. If the temperatures on different days were indepdentent of each other, the probability of the peak temperature exceeding $T$ on at least one day in the year would simply be $(1 - p^{N})$, where $N=365$. However, the temperature on consecutive days are not independent of each other. In this analysis, we approximately capture this by using a lower $N$. For example, if we can assume that the temperatures on days 7 or more days apart are independent, we can use $N=52$."
