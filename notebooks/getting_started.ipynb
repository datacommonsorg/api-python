        "\n",
        "Data Commons is an open knowledge graph of structured data. It contains statements about real world objects such as\n",
        "\n",
        "* [Santa Clara County](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06085) is contained in the [State of California](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06)\n",
        "* The latitude of [Berkeley, CA](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/0606000) is 37.8703\n",
        "* The [population of all persons in Maryland ](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=dc/o/6w1c9qk7hxjch)has a total count of 5,996,080.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the graph, [*entities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) like [Santa Clara County](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06085) are represented by nodes. Every node is uniquely identified by its **`dcid`** (Data Commons Identifier) and has a **`type`** corresponding to what the node represents. For example, [California](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06) is identified by the dcid `geoId/06` and is of type [State](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=State). *Relations* between entities are represented by directed edges between these nodes. For example, the statement \"Santa Clara County is contained in the State of California\" is represented in the graph as two nodes: \"Santa Clara County\" and \"California\" with an edge labeled \"[containedInPlace](https://schema.org/containedInPlace)\" pointing from Santa Clara to California. This can be visualized by the following diagram.\n",

        "\n",
        "Notice that the direction is important! One can say that \"Santa Clara County\" is containedInPlace of \"California\", but \"California\" is certainly not contained in \"Santa Clara County\"! In general, how Data Commons models data is similar to the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) Data Model as  Data Commons leverages schema.org to provide a common set of types and properties. For a broader discussion on how data is modeled in Data Commons, one can refer to documentation on the [Schema.org data model](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html).\n",
