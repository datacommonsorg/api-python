Many studies have been done on the medical bases of the disease, but it is widely known that societal factors, like public policy, can greatly affect case numbers. Today, we'll take advantage of Data Commons, an open-source project that allows us to easily combine data from multiple different sources, to analyze the impact of social factors on COVID-19 cases. While public policy is hard to quantify into a data point, perhaps we can find other social factors that correlate with the number of COVID-19 cases.\n",

        "Before proceeding with our model, we first need to clean our data. Sometimes our data comes to us incomplete, with missing values, or in a different unit than we were expecting. It's always best practice to look through your data to make sure there are no corrupt, inaccurate, or missing records. If we do find such entries, we need to replace, motify, or remove that data. The process of correcting or removing bad data is known as **data cleaning**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some common things to look out for:\n",
        "* Data can be missing (e.g. an empty cell in a column). Depending on your application and context, sometimes there's a clear \"default\" value that can be filled in.\n",
        "* Duplicate rows or columns. You will need to delete the extras.\n",
        "* The format of the data you're provided is incorrect. This can include strange naming conventions, typos, strange capitalization, or inconsistencies (e.g. having both \"N/A\" and \"Not Applicable\" appear).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.3A)** Why bother replacing/modifying/removing \"dirty\" data in the first place? What do you think would happen if we found \"dirty\" data, but trained a model on such data without data cleaning first?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.3B)**  How would you approach handling any NaN or empty values in a dataframe? Should we remove that row? Remove the feature? Or should we replace NaNs with a particular value (and if so, how do you decide what value that should be)?\n",
        " \n",
        "\n",
        "**1.3C)**  Take a look at the dataframe outputted by the code box above from section 1.2. Are there any values that need to be cleaned? If so, write code to implement the answers to the above questions using the code box below.\n",
        "\n",
        "_Hint: If you're strugging, check out the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) for methods you can use to manipulate the data in the data frame._"
